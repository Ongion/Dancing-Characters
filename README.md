# Instructions

Wait until I make a release zip. Then, download that release and unzip it directly into the Characters folder of your Stepmania / Project Outfox installation.
I'll put a link to the latest release zip right here once I've done that, because not everyone is a programmer who commonly uses GitHub, and GitHub is a confusing place!

Alternatively, just download the repository as a zip folder, and then unzip into the Characters folder. I'm not your boss, you don't have to wait!

# Instructions

Download the "Source code" zip from [here](https://github.com/Ongion/Dancing-Characters/releases/latest). Then, unzip it directly into the Characters folder of your Stepmania / Project Outfox installation.

Alternatively, just download the repository as a zip folder using that "Code" dropdown at the top, and then unzip into the Characters folder. I'm not your boss, you don't have to wait for a full release if I've added new characters!


## Known Issues
Right now, the characters looks like they're completely in shadow on Stepmania. This is known, and a fix is in the works!
Additionally, Megumin's textures use a format that doesn't load properly on Stepmania. I'll be converting those to PNGs when I fix the lighting issue.
